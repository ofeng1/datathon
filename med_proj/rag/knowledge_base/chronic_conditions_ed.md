# Chronic Conditions and ED Utilization

## High-Frequency ED Conditions

Chronic conditions associated with frequent ED revisits:

### Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
- 30-day readmission rate ~25%
- Key interventions: daily weights, sodium restriction education, diuretic titration, cardiology follow-up within 7 days.
- Warning signs to teach patients: worsening dyspnea, sudden weight gain > 3 lbs in 24 hours, peripheral edema.

### COPD
- Exacerbations are the leading cause of COPD-related ED revisits.
- Ensure inhaler technique is correct before discharge.
- Prescribe a COPD action plan. Start oral corticosteroids if not already initiated.
- Smoking cessation counseling at every visit.

### Diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2)
- Hypo- and hyperglycemic events drive frequent ED visits.
- Review insulin regimen, ensure glucometer access, refer to diabetes educator.
- Screen for diabetic complications (neuropathy, nephropathy) if not recently done.

### Chronic Kidney Disease / ESRD
- Electrolyte emergencies, fluid overload, and vascular access issues.
- Coordinate with nephrology and dialysis center before discharge.

### Substance Use Disorders
- High revisit rates, often with co-occurring mental health conditions.
- Consider medication-assisted treatment (MAT) initiation in the ED.
- Warm handoff to addiction medicine or peer recovery coach.

### Depression and Anxiety
- Screen with PHQ-2 / PHQ-9 at ED visit.
- Safety assessment for suicidal ideation (Columbia Protocol).
- Behavioral health follow-up within 72 hours for moderate-to-severe cases.

## Comorbidity Burden

Patients with ≥ 3 chronic conditions (TOTCHRON ≥ 3 in NHAMCS) have significantly higher revisit rates. Interventions should focus on care coordination across specialties and comprehensive medication management.
