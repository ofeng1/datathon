# Discharge Planning and Follow-Up Best Practices

## Structured Discharge Checklist

1. **Diagnosis communicated** in plain language the patient understands.
2. **Medication reconciliation** completed — new prescriptions explained, interactions reviewed.
3. **Follow-up appointment** scheduled (PCP within 48–72 hours for high-risk patients).
4. **Warning signs** ("return-if" instructions) provided in writing.
5. **Transportation and social needs** assessed before discharge.

## High-Risk Discharge Populations

Patients at elevated risk of 72-hour ED revisit require enhanced discharge planning:

- **Elderly (age ≥ 65)**: Cognitive screening, fall risk assessment, home safety evaluation.
- **Chronic disease burden (≥ 3 conditions)**: Ensure specialist follow-up and medication adherence plan.
- **Mental health / substance use**: Warm handoff to behavioral health, crisis safety plan.
- **Pain management**: Opioid alternatives discussed, pain contract if applicable.
- **Uninsured / underinsured**: Social work referral, community health center connection.

## Transitional Care Interventions

| Intervention | Evidence Level | Target Population |
|---|---|---|
| Nurse follow-up call within 48h | Strong | All high-risk discharges |
| Pharmacist-led med reconciliation | Strong | Polypharmacy patients |
| Home health referral | Moderate | Elderly with functional limitations |
| Patient navigator / CHW | Moderate | Patients with social barriers |
| Telehealth follow-up visit | Emerging | Rural / transportation-limited |

## Teach-Back Method

Before discharge, use the teach-back technique: ask the patient to explain their diagnosis, medications, and when to return in their own words. This reduces revisits by improving comprehension.
