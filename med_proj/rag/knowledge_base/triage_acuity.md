# Triage Acuity and Risk Stratification

## Emergency Severity Index (ESI)

The NHAMCS variable IMMEDR captures the immediacy / triage acuity of the ED visit:

| IMMEDR Value | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediate | Life-threatening, requires immediate intervention |
| 2 | Emergent | High risk of deterioration, needs rapid evaluation |
| 3 | Urgent | Stable but requires multiple resources |
| 4 | Semi-urgent | Low acuity, 1–2 resources expected |
| 5 | Non-urgent | Could be managed in primary care setting |

## Vital Sign Red Flags

Abnormal vitals at triage increase risk of admission and poor outcomes:

- **Temperature** (TEMPF): Fever > 100.4°F or hypothermia < 95°F
- **Heart rate** (PULSE): Tachycardia > 100 bpm or bradycardia < 50 bpm
- **Respiratory rate** (RESPR): Tachypnea > 22 breaths/min
- **Blood pressure** (BPSYS/BPDIAS): Hypotension SBP < 90 mmHg or hypertensive crisis SBP > 180 mmHg
- **Oxygen saturation** (POPCT): Hypoxia < 92%

Patients presenting with ≥ 2 abnormal vitals should be flagged for admission risk evaluation.

## Pain Assessment

PAINSCALE ≥ 7 (severe pain) is associated with:
- Longer ED length of stay
- Higher likelihood of opioid administration
- Increased 72-hour revisit risk if pain is inadequately managed at discharge
