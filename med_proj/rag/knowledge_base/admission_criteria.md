# ED-to-Inpatient Admission Decision Support

## When to Admit from the ED

General indications for hospital admission from the emergency department:

### Clinical Criteria
- Hemodynamic instability requiring ongoing monitoring or vasopressors
- Acute respiratory failure or need for supplemental oxygen > 4L/min
- Acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or other time-sensitive diagnoses
- Severe infection requiring IV antibiotics (sepsis, complicated pneumonia)
- Acute surgical conditions (appendicitis, bowel obstruction, fractures requiring OR)
- Altered mental status without rapidly reversible cause
- Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state

### Observation vs. Inpatient

Consider observation status (< 48 hours expected stay) for:
- Chest pain with low-to-intermediate risk and pending stress test
- Asthma exacerbation responding to treatment but not yet stable
- Syncope with cardiac risk factors requiring telemetry
- Mild-to-moderate CHF exacerbation responding to diuretics

### Social Admission Considerations

Even when clinical criteria for discharge are met, consider admission or extended observation when:
- Patient is unable to care for themselves at home
- No safe discharge destination (homelessness, unsafe home environment)
- Inability to obtain critical medications
- High risk of non-compliance with outpatient follow-up

## NHAMCS Admission Variables

- **ADMITHOS**: Direct indicator of hospital admission from ED (1 = admitted)
- **ADMIT**: Disposition category including admission, transfer, and observation
- Patients with IMMEDR = 1 or 2 have substantially higher admission rates
